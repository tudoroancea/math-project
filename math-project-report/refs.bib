  abstract  = {{An introduction to the mathematical theory of multistage decision processes, this text takes a "functional equation" approach to the discovery of optimum policies. Written by a leading developer of such policies, it presents a series of methods, uniqueness and existence theorems, and examples for solving the relevant equations. The text examines existence and uniqueness theorems, the optimal inventory equation, bottleneck problems in multistage production processes, a new formalism in the calculus of variation, strategies behind multistage games, and Markovian decision processes. Each chapter concludes with a problem set that Eric V. Denardo of Yale University, in his informative new introduction, calls "a rich lode of applications and research topics." 1957 edition. 37 figures.}},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present an automatic C-code generation strategy for real-time nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC), which is designed for applications with kilohertz sample rates. The corresponding code export module has been implemented within the software package ACADO Toolkit. It is capable of exporting fixed step-size integrators together with their sensitivities as well as a real-time Gauss–Newton method. Here, we employ the symbolic representation of optimal control problems in ACADO in order to auto-generate plain C-code which is optimized for final production. The exported code has been tested for model predictive control scenarios comprising constrained nonlinear dynamic systems with four states and a control horizon of ten samples. The numerical simulations show a promising performance of the exported code being able to provide feedback in much less than a millisecond.}

  abstract = { An efficient Newton-type scheme for the approximate on-line solution of optimization problems as they occur in optimal feedback control is presented. The scheme allows a fast reaction to disturbances by delivering approximations of the exact optimal feedback control which are iteratively refined during the runtime of the controlled process. The contractivity of this real-time iteration scheme is proven, and a bound on the loss of optimality---compared with the theoretical optimal solution---is given. The robustness and excellent real-time performance of the method is demonstrated in a numerical experiment, the control of an unstable system, namely, an airborne kite that shall fly loops. }
