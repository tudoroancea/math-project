# Study of Relaxed Recentered Log-Barrier functions based Nonlinear Model Predictive control (or for short, study of RRLB NMPC)

In this repo you can find my LaTeX report in the directory `math-project-report`, as well as all my code for the experiments in the directory `math-project-num-experiments`.
A bunch of other files are included in the `misc` directory and are previous versions of experiments that I wanted to keep within easy reach.

The `main` branch corresponds to the state of the project when I submitted it, and any work I do after that can be found on the `develop` branch.
